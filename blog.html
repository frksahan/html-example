            <p>Communication (from Latin communicare, meaning "to share" or "to be in relation with")[1][2][3] is "an
                apparent answer to the painful divisions between self and other, private and public, and inner thought
                and outer world."[4] As this definition indicates, communication is difficult to define in a consistent
                manner,[5][6] because it is commonly used to refer to a wide range of different behaviors (broadly: "the
                transfer of information"[7][8]), or to limit what can be included in the category of communication (for
                example, requiring a "conscious intent" to persuade[9]). John Peters argues the difficulty of defining
                communication emerges from the fact that communication is both a universal phenomenon (because everyone
                communicates) and a specific discipline of institutional academic study.[10]</p>
